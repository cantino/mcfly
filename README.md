# McFly - fly through your shell history

<img src="/docs/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" width="400">

McFly replaces your default `ctrl-r` shell history search with an intelligent search engine that takes into account
your working directory and the context of recently executed commands. McFly's suggestions are prioritized
in real time with a small neural network.

TL;DR: an upgraded `ctrl-r` where history results make sense for what you're working on right now.

## Features

* Rebinds `ctrl-r` to bring up a full-screen reverse history search prioritized with a small neural network.
* Augments your shell history to track command exit status, timestamp, and execution directory in a SQLite database.
* Maintains your normal shell history file as well so that you can stop using McFly whenever you want.
* Unicode support throughout.
* Includes a simple action to scrub any history item from the McFly database and your shell history files.
* Designed to be extensible for other shells in the future.
* Written in Rust, so it's fast and safe.
* You can type `%` to match any number of characters when searching.

## Prioritization

The key feature of McFly is smart command prioritization powered by a small neural network that runs
in real time. The goal is for the command you want to run to always be one of the top suggestions.

When suggesting a command, McFly takes into consideration:

* The directory where you ran the command. You're likely to run that command in the same directory in the future.
* What commands you typed before the command (e.g., the command's execution context).
* How often you run the command.
* When you last ran the command.
* If you've selected the command in McFly before.
* The command's historical exit status. You probably don't want to run old failed commands.

* `$(mcfly init zsh)` will be executed after prompt

## iTerm2

To avoid McFly's UI messing up your scrollback history in iTerm2, make sure this option is unchecked:

<img src="/docs/iterm2.jpeg" alt="iterm2 UI instructions">

## Dump history

McFly can dump the command history into *stdout*.

For example:
```bash
mcfly dump --since '2023-01-01' --before '2023-09-12 09:15:30'
```
will dump the command run between *2023-01-01 00:00:00.0* to *2023-09-12 09:15:30*(**exclusive**) as **json**.
You can specify **csv** as dump format via `--format csv` as well.

Each item in dumped commands has the following fields:
* `cmd`: The run command.
* `when_run`: The time when the command ran in your local timezone.

You can dump all the commands history without any arguments:
```bash
mcfly dump
```

### Timestamp format
McFly use [chrono-systemd-time-ng] parsing timestamp.

**chrono-systemd-time-ng** is a non-strict implementation of [systemd.time](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html), with the following exceptions:
* time units **must** accompany all time span values.
* time zone suffixes are **not** supported.
* weekday prefixes are **not** supported.

Users of McFly simply need to understand **specifying timezone in timestamp isn't allowed**.
McFly will always use your **local timezone**.

For more details, please refer to [the document of chrono-systemd-time-ng][chrono-systemd-time-ng].

[chrono-systemd-time-ng]: https://docs.rs/chrono-systemd-time-ng/latest/chrono_systemd_time/

### Regex
*Dump* supports filtering commands with regex.
The regex syntax follows [crate regex](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).

For example:
```bash
mcfly dump -r '^cargo run'
```
will dump all command prefixes with `cargo run`.

You can use `-r/--regex` and time options at the same time.

For example:
```bash
mcfly dump -r '^cargo run' --since '2023-09-12 09:15:30'
```
will dump all command prefixes with `cargo run` ran since *2023-09-12 09:15:30*.

## Settings
A number of settings can be set via environment variables. To set a setting you should add the following snippets to your `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` / `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

### Light Mode
To swap the color scheme for use in a light terminal, set the environment variable `MCFLY_LIGHT`.

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_LIGHT=TRUE
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_LIGHT TRUE
```

Tip: on macOS you can use the following snippet for color scheme to be configured based on system-wide settings:

bash / zsh:
```bash
if [[ "$(defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle 2&>/dev/null)" != "Dark" ]]; then
    export MCFLY_LIGHT=TRUE
fi
```


### VIM Key Scheme
By default Mcfly uses an `emacs` inspired key scheme. If you would like to switch to the `vim` inspired key scheme, set the environment variable `MCFLY_KEY_SCHEME`.

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_KEY_SCHEME=vim
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_KEY_SCHEME vim
```

### Fuzzy Searching
To enable fuzzy searching, set `MCFLY_FUZZY` to an integer. 0 is off; higher numbers weight toward shorter matches. Values in the 2-5 range get good results so far; try a few and [report what works best for you](https://github.com/cantino/mcfly/issues/183)!

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_FUZZY=2
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_FUZZY 2
```

### Results Count
To change the maximum number of results shown, set `MCFLY_RESULTS` (default: 10).

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_RESULTS=50
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_RESULTS 50
```

### Delete without confirmation
To delete without confirmation, set `MCFLY_DELETE_WITHOUT_CONFIRM` to true.

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_DELETE_WITHOUT_CONFIRM=true
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_DELETE_WITHOUT_CONFIRM true
```

### Interface view
To change interface view, set `MCFLY_INTERFACE_VIEW` (default: `TOP`).
Available options: `TOP` and `BOTTOM`

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_INTERFACE_VIEW=BOTTOM
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_INTERFACE_VIEW BOTTOM
```

### Disable menu interface
To disable the menu interface, set the environment variable `MCFLY_DISABLE_MENU`.

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_DISABLE_MENU=TRUE
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_DISABLE_MENU TRUE
```

### Results sorting
To change the sorting of results shown, set `MCFLY_RESULTS_SORT` (default: RANK).
Possible values `RANK` and `LAST_RUN`

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_RESULTS_SORT=LAST_RUN
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_RESULTS_SORT LAST_RUN
```

### Custom Prompt
To change the prompt, set `MCFLY_PROMPT` (default: `$`).

bash / zsh:
```bash
export MCFLY_PROMPT="❯"
```

fish:
```bash
set -gx MCFLY_PROMPT "❯"
```
Note that only single-character-prompts are allowed. setting `MCFLY_PROMPT` to `"<str>"` will reset it to the default prompt.

### Database Location

McFly stores its SQLite database in the standard location for the OS. On OS X, this is in `~/Library/Application Support/McFly` and on Linux it is in `$XDG_DATA_DIR/mcfly/history.db` (default would be `~/.local/share/mcfly/history.db`). For legacy support, if `~/.mcfly/` exists, it is used instead.

### Slow startup

If you have a very large history database and you notice that McFly launches slowly, you can set `MCFLY_HISTORY_LIMIT` to something like 10000 to limit how many records are considered when searching. In this example, McFly would search only the latest 10,000 entries.

## HISTTIMEFORMAT

McFly currently doesn't parse or use `HISTTIMEFORMAT`.

## Possible Future Features

* Add a screencast to README.
* Learn common command options and autocomplete them in the suggestion UI?
* Sort command line args when coming up with the template matching string.
* Possible prioritization improvements:
  * Cross validation & explicit training set selection.
  * Learn command embeddings
